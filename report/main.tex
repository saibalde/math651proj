\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item What's the problem
  \item Why is it important
  \item What makes it hard, challenging
  \item What's your solution
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem}

Discuss the background, set-up of the problem and then discuss your solution,
proofs?, etc.  Is there an algorithm? If so, put it here.

\section{Results}

This is the right place for numerical experiments if you have them.  Discuss why
they are meaningful, what is important about the experimental set-up for
engineering purposes, etc.

\section{Conclusion}

What conclusions do you draw from your results?  What's missing from your
approach?  What are the next steps?
